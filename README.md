# Java File Compressor

A desktop application that allows users to compress and decompress files using various compression algorithms.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

1. File Selection

   - Allow users to select files through a file picker dialog
   - Support drag-and-drop functionality for files
   - Display selected file information (name, size, type)

2. Compression Options

   - Support multiple compression algorithms:
     - ZIP compression (default)
     - GZIP compression
     - BZIP2 compression
   - Allow users to select compression level (1-9)
   - Option to preserve original file structure

3. Compression Process

   - Show compression progress
   - Display compression ratio
   - Allow cancellation of compression process
   - Handle large files efficiently

4. Decompression
   - Support decompression of previously compressed files
   - Maintain original file names and structure
   - Validate compressed files before decompression

### User Interface Requirements

1. Main Window

   - Clean, modern interface
   - Intuitive layout with clear sections
   - Dark/Light theme support

2. Controls

   - File selection button
   - Compression algorithm selection dropdown
   - Compression level slider
   - Start/Stop compression buttons
   - Progress bar
   - Status messages

3. Information Display
   - File details panel
   - Compression statistics
   - Error messages and notifications

## Technical Requirements

### Development Environment

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- JavaFX for the user interface
- Maven for project management
- JUnit for testing

### Dependencies

- Apache Commons Compress for compression algorithms
- SLF4J for logging
- JUnit 5 for testing

### Performance Requirements

- Handle files up to 2GB in size
- Maximum memory usage of 512MB
- Compression time should be reasonable (benchmark: 100MB file in < 30 seconds)
- Responsive UI during compression operations

### Security Requirements

- Validate file types before compression
- Prevent malicious file operations
- Secure file handling practices
- No sensitive data exposure in logs

### Error Handling

- Graceful handling of:
  - Corrupted files
  - Insufficient disk space
  - File permission issues
  - Invalid compression formats
  - Memory constraints

## Future Enhancements

1. Batch processing of multiple files
2. Custom compression algorithm support
3. File encryption during compression
4. Cloud storage integration
5. Compression history and favorites
6. Scheduled compression tasks

## Development Phases

1. Basic UI implementation
2. Core compression functionality
3. Progress tracking and cancellation
4. Error handling and validation
5. Performance optimization
6. Testing and bug fixes
7. Documentation and user guide
